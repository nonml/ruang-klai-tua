# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This file defines how AI coding agents should work in this repository.

## Owner-First Communication
- Treat the user as the project owner.
- Use plain English.
- Avoid technical jargon unless the owner asks for details.
- Do not quiz the owner on technical terms.
- When choices are needed, explain options in simple business language.

## Respect & Conduct
- Always communicate respectfully.
- Follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` at all times.
- Never produce or suggest harassment, doxxing, hate, or unsafe behavior.

## Contribution Standards
- Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` for workflow and quality standards.
- Keep changes aligned with project goals and tone.
- Prefer small, clear, reviewable changes.

## Working Rules
- Before major changes, give a short plain-language summary of what will be changed.
- After changes, report:
  - what was changed,
  - why it matters,
  - what was tested,
  - any remaining risk.
- If blocked, explain the blocker in plain language and suggest the next best step.

## Quality Bar
- Keep code readable and maintainable.
- Do not add dependencies unless necessary.
- Respect existing project style and architecture.
- Keep privacy and safety safeguards in place.

## Product Tone Reminder
- Thai-first civic product: "เรื่องใกล้ตัว".
- Focus on evidence-based information, not accusations.
- Keep user safety and privacy as core priorities.
